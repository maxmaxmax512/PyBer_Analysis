# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

In this project, our firm was asked to analyze ride-sharing data by city type. After breaking data into rural, suburban, and urban categories, we plotted weekly fares on a line graph to see trends over time. After our analysis was complete, we compiled this report for review.

## Results

Here are the differences between each city:

* Urban: 
  * highest number of rides and drivers
  * lowest average fare per ride and 
  * lowest average fare per driver
  * highest total fare

* Suburban: 
  * fewer rides than urban cities (50%)
  * fewer drivers compared to urban cities (20%)
  * higher average fare per ride than urban rides (about $6 more) 
  * average fare per driver higher than urban cities (about 200%)
  * total fares lower than urban (50%)

* Rural: 
  * Rural cities came out with the lowest number of rides and drivers. 
  * Rural cities also had the highest average fare per ride and per driver. 
  * The total fares for rural cities was way less than suburban and urban total fares.

## Summary

To address the disparities among types of cities, here are my recommendations:
