# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

In this project, our firm was asked to analyze ride-sharing data by city type. After breaking data into rural, suburban, and urban categories, we plotted weekly fares on a line graph to see trends over time. After our analysis was complete, we compiled this report for review.

## Results

Here are the differences between each city:

* Urban Data: 
  * highest number of rides and drivers
  * lowest average fare per ride & per driver
  * highest total fares

* Suburban Data: 
  * fewer rides & drivers compared to urban cities
  * higher than average fare per ride & per driver 
  * total fares lower (50% of urban total)

* Rural Data: 
  * lowest number of rides and drivers. 
  * highest average fare per ride and per driver
  * lowest total fares (~11% of urban total)
